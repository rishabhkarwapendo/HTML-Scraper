# HTML-Scraper
Python version: 3.8.9 64-bit. (Used for running the python files in the main branch) <br />
If you do not have a developer environment, dependencies, or Python installed, you can run all the files by downloading the executable files in the exe_runnables folder. <br />
The regular executables (outside the faster_execs folder) take about 12 seconds to run since the dependencies are all bundled in the same executable <br />
If you do not mind the dependencies being in a folder with the executable, then download the faster executable zip files. <br />
When running the python or executable files, the input file should be in the same directory as where your program is. <br />
