p,2,8,"These instructions illustrate all major features of Beautiful Soup 4,
with examples. I show you what the library is good for, how it works,
how to use it, how to make it do what you want, and what to do when it
violates your expectations."
p,3,8,"This document covers Beautiful Soup version 4.11.0. The examples in
this documentation were written for Python 3.8."
p,5,8,"This documentation has been translated into other languages by
Beautiful Soup users:"
p,14,8,Here are some simple ways to navigate that data structure:
p,15,8,One common task is extracting all the URLs found within a page’s <a> tags:
p,16,8,Another common task is extracting all the text from a page:
p,17,8,"Does this look like what you need? If so, read on."
p,18,8,"If you’re using a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can
install Beautiful Soup with the system package manager:"
p,27,8,"I use Python 3.8 to develop Beautiful Soup, but it should work with
other recent versions."
p,36,9,This table summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each parser library:
p,37,13,Parser
p,38,13,Typical usage
p,39,13,Advantages
p,40,13,Disadvantages
p,41,13,Python’s html.parser
p,43,15,Batteries included
p,44,15,Decent speed
p,45,15,Lenient (As of Python 3.2)
p,46,15,"Not as fast as lxml,
less lenient than
html5lib."
p,47,13,lxml’s HTML parser
p,49,15,Very fast
p,50,15,Lenient
p,51,15,External C dependency
p,52,13,lxml’s XML parser
p,54,15,Very fast
p,55,15,"The only currently supported
XML parser"
p,56,15,External C dependency
p,57,13,html5lib
p,59,15,Extremely lenient
p,60,15,"Parses pages the same way a
web browser does"
p,61,15,Creates valid HTML5
p,62,15,Very slow
p,63,15,"External Python
dependency"
p,67,8,"First, the document is converted to Unicode, and HTML entities are
converted to Unicode characters:"
p,73,10,"If you change a tag’s name, the change will be reflected in any HTML
markup generated by Beautiful Soup:"
p,76,10,"You can add, remove, and modify a tag’s attributes. Again, this is
done by treating the tag as a dictionary:"
p,79,11,"When you turn a tag back into a string, multiple attribute values are
consolidated:"
p,82,11,"If you parse a document as XML, there are no multi-valued attributes:"
p,84,11,"You probably won’t need to do this, but if you do, use the defaults as
a guide. They implement the rules described in the HTML specification:"
p,98,8,Here’s the “Three sisters” HTML document again:
p,99,8,"I’ll use this as an example to show you how to move from one part of
a document to another."
p,101,9,"Note that Beautiful Soup strings don’t support any of these
attributes, because a string can’t have children."
p,103,10,"You can do use this trick again and again to zoom in on a certain part
of the parse tree. This code gets the first <b> tag beneath the <body> tag:"
p,119,10,"Here, strings consisting entirely of whitespace are ignored, and
whitespace at the beginning and end of strings is removed."
p,122,10,"The title string itself has a parent: the <title> tag that contains
it:"
p,126,9,Consider a simple document like this:
p,135,9,Take a look at the beginning of the “three sisters” document:
p,136,9,"An HTML parser takes this string of characters and turns it into a
series of events: “open an <html> tag”, “open a <head> tag”, “open a
<title> tag”, “add a string”, “close the <title> tag”, “open a <p>
tag”, and so on. Beautiful Soup offers tools for reconstructing the
initial parse of the document."
p,140,10,"That’s because in the original markup, the word “Tillie” appeared
before that semicolon. The parser encountered an <a> tag, then the
word “Tillie”, then the closing </a> tag, then the semicolon and rest of
the sentence. The semicolon is on the same level as the <a> tag, but the
word “Tillie” was encountered first."
p,142,10,"You should get the idea by now. You can use these iterators to move
forward or backward in the document as it was parsed:"
p,144,8,"Once again, I’ll be using the “three sisters” document as an example:"
p,147,10,"The simplest filter is a string. Pass a string to a search method and
Beautiful Soup will perform a match against that exact string. This
code finds all the <b> tags in the document:"
p,148,10,"If you pass in a byte string, Beautiful Soup will assume the string is
encoded as UTF-8. You can avoid this by passing in a Unicode string instead."
p,150,10,This code finds all the tags whose names contain the letter ‘t’:
p,156,10,"This function only picks up the <p> tags. It doesn’t pick up the <a>
tags, because those tags define both “class” and “id”. It doesn’t pick
up tags like <html> and <title>, because those tags don’t define
“class”."
p,159,10,Now we’re ready to look at the search methods in detail.
p,164,10,This is the simplest usage:
p,170,10,"You can filter multiple attributes at once by passing in more than one
keyword argument:"
p,171,10,"Some attributes, like the data-* attributes in HTML 5, have names that
can’t be used as the names of keyword arguments:"
p,178,10,But searching for variants of the string value won’t work:
p,179,10,"If you want to search for tags that match two or more CSS classes, you
should use a CSS selector:"
p,185,10,"There are three links in the “three sisters” document, but this code
only finds the first two:"
p,187,10,Here’s that part of the document:
p,191,9,These two lines are also equivalent:
p,212,9,"In the first example, the string “Elsie” showed up, even though it was
contained within the <a> tag we started from. In the second example,
the last <p> tag in the document showed up, even though it’s not in
the same part of the tree as the <a> tag we started from. For these
methods, all that matters is that an element match the filter, and
show up later in the document than the starting element."
p,220,9,You can find tags:
p,221,9,Find tags beneath other tags:
p,223,9,Find the siblings of tags:
p,224,9,Find tags by CSS class:
p,225,9,Find tags by ID:
p,226,9,Find tags that match any selector from a list of selectors:
p,227,9,Test for the existence of an attribute:
p,228,9,Find tags by attribute value:
p,230,9,"If you’ve parsed XML that defines namespaces, you can use them in CSS
selectors.:"
p,231,9,"When handling a CSS selector that uses namespaces, Beautiful Soup
always tries to use namespace prefixes that make sense based on what
it saw while parsing the document. You can always provide your own
dictionary of abbreviations:"
p,233,8,"Beautiful Soup’s main strength is in searching the parse tree, but you
can also modify the tree and write your changes as a new HTML or XML
document."
p,236,9,"Be careful: if the tag contained other tags, they and all their
contents will be destroyed."
p,243,9,"Only the first argument, the tag name, is required."
p,268,9,"If you give Beautiful Soup a document that contains HTML entities like
“&lquot;”, they’ll be converted to Unicode characters:"
p,269,9,"If you then convert the document to a bytestring, the Unicode characters
will be encoded as UTF-8. You won’t get the HTML entities back:"
p,270,9,"By default, the only characters that are escaped upon output are bare
ampersands and angle brackets. These get turned into “&amp;”, “&lt;”,
and “&gt;”, so that Beautiful Soup doesn’t inadvertently generate
invalid HTML or XML:"
p,275,9,"In addition, any attributes whose values are the empty string
will become HTML-style boolean attributes:"
p,279,9,Here’s a formatter that increases the indentation when pretty-printing:
p,284,9,"You can specify a string to be used to join the bits of text
together:"
p,285,9,"You can tell Beautiful Soup to strip whitespace from the beginning and
end of each bit of text:"
p,291,8,"If you don’t specify anything, you’ll get the best HTML parser that’s
installed. Beautiful Soup ranks lxml’s parser as being the best, then
html5lib’s, then Python’s built-in parser. You can override this by
specifying one of the following:"
p,292,10,"What type of markup you want to parse. Currently supported are
“html”, “xml”, and “html5”."
p,293,10,"The name of the parser library you want to use. Currently supported
options are “lxml”, “html5lib”, and “html.parser” (Python’s
built-in HTML parser)."
p,295,8,"If you don’t have an appropriate parser installed, Beautiful Soup will
ignore your request and pick a different parser. Right now, the only
supported XML parser is lxml. If you don’t have lxml installed, asking
for an XML parser won’t give you one, and asking for “lxml” won’t work
either."
p,296,9,"Beautiful Soup presents the same interface to a number of different
parsers, but each parser is different. Different parsers will create
different parse trees from the same document. The biggest differences
are between the HTML parsers and the XML parsers. Here’s a short
document, parsed as HTML using the parser that comes with Python:"
p,297,9,"Since a standalone <b/> tag is not valid HTML, html.parser turns it into
a <b></b> tag pair."
p,298,9,"Here’s the same document parsed as XML (running this requires that you
have lxml installed). Note that the standalone <b/> tag is left alone, and
that the document is given an XML declaration instead of being put
into an <html> tag.:"
p,299,9,"There are also differences between HTML parsers. If you give Beautiful
Soup a perfectly-formed HTML document, these differences won’t
matter. One parser will be faster than another, but they’ll all give
you a data structure that looks exactly like the original HTML
document."
p,300,9,"But if the document is not perfectly-formed, different parsers will
give different results. Here’s a short, invalid document parsed using
lxml’s HTML parser. Note that the <a> tag gets wrapped in <body> and
<html> tags, and the dangling </p> tag is simply ignored:"
p,301,9,Here’s the same document parsed using html5lib:
p,302,9,"Instead of ignoring the dangling </p> tag, html5lib pairs it with an
opening <p> tag. html5lib also adds an empty <head> tag; lxml didn’t
bother."
p,303,9,"Here’s the same document parsed with Python’s built-in HTML
parser:"
p,304,9,"Like lxml, this parser ignores the closing </p> tag. Unlike
html5lib or lxml, this parser makes no attempt to create a
well-formed HTML document by adding <html> or <body> tags."
p,305,9,"Since the document “<a></p>” is invalid, none of these techniques is
the ‘correct’ way to handle it. The html5lib parser uses techniques
that are part of the HTML5 standard, so it has the best claim on being
the ‘correct’ way, but all three techniques are legitimate."
p,307,8,"Any HTML or XML document is written in a specific encoding like ASCII
or UTF-8.  But when you load that document into Beautiful Soup, you’ll
discover it’s been converted to Unicode:"
p,310,8,"Here’s a document written in ISO-8859-8. The document is so short that
Unicode, Dammit can’t get a lock on it, and misidentifies it as
ISO-8859-7:"
p,315,9,"When you write out a document from Beautiful Soup, you get a UTF-8
document, even if the document wasn’t in UTF-8 to begin with. Here’s a
document written in the Latin-1 encoding:"
p,316,9,"Note that the <meta> tag has been rewritten to reflect the fact that
the document is now in UTF-8."
p,319,9,"Any characters that can’t be represented in your chosen encoding will
be converted into numeric XML entity references. Here’s a document
that includes the Unicode character SNOWMAN:"
p,320,9,"The SNOWMAN character can be part of a UTF-8 document (it looks like
☃), but there’s no representation for that character in ISO-Latin-1 or
ASCII, so it’s converted into “&#9731” for those encodings:"
p,321,9,"You can use Unicode, Dammit without using Beautiful Soup. It’s useful
whenever you have data in an unknown encoding and you just want it to
become Unicode:"
p,323,9,"Unicode, Dammit has two special features that Beautiful Soup doesn’t
use."
p,324,10,"You can use Unicode, Dammit to convert Microsoft smart quotes to HTML or XML
entities:"
p,325,10,You can also convert Microsoft smart quotes to ASCII quotes:
p,326,10,"Hopefully you’ll find this feature useful, but Beautiful Soup doesn’t
use it. Beautiful Soup prefers the default behavior, which is to
convert Microsoft smart quotes to Unicode characters along with
everything else:"
p,328,10,"This document is a mess. The snowmen are in UTF-8 and the quotes are
in Windows-1252. You can display the snowmen or the quotes, but not
both:"
p,340,8,"The copy is considered equal to the original, since it represents the
same markup as the original, but it’s not the same object:"
p,343,8,"Beautiful Soup offers a number of ways to customize how the parser
treats incoming HTML and XML. This section covers the most commonly
used customization techniques."
p,354,9,The default behavior is to use the last value found for the tag:
p,356,9,"(lxml and html5lib always do it this way; their behavior can’t be
configured from within Beautiful Soup.)"
p,357,9,"If you need more, you can pass in a function that’s called on each duplicate value:"
p,360,9,"This can be useful when incorporating Beautiful Soup into a test
framework."
p,386,8,"New translations of the Beautiful Soup documentation are greatly
appreciated. Translations should be licensed under the MIT license,
just like Beautiful Soup and its English documentation are."
p,387,8,"There are two ways of getting your translation into the main code base
and onto the Beautiful Soup website:"
p,388,10,"Create a branch of the Beautiful Soup repository, add your
translation, and propose a merge with the main branch, the same
as you would do with a proposed change to the source code."
p,389,10,"Send a message to the Beautiful Soup discussion group with a link to
your translation, or attach your translation to the message."
p,391,8,"Beautiful Soup 3 is the previous release series, and is no longer
being actively developed. It’s currently packaged with all major Linux
distributions:"
p,400,9,becomes this:
p,404,9,Here’s what you’ll need to know to convert your BS3 code and habits to BS4:
p,424,10,"Some arguments to the Beautiful Soup constructor were renamed for the
same reasons:"
p,427,10,I renamed one method for compatibility with Python 3:
p,429,10,I renamed one attribute to use more accurate terminology:
p,435,10,"These methods are left over from the Beautiful Soup 2 API. They’ve
been deprecated since 2006, and should not be used at all:"
p,443,10,"I gave the generators PEP 8-compliant names, and transformed them into
properties:"
p,451,10,So instead of this:
p,452,10,You can write this:
p,453,10,(But the old code will still work.)
